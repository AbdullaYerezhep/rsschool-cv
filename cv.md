## About me:
  My goal is to become a full-stack developer within the next three years. I studied the basics of computer science at the University of Information Technology and Management, specializing in IT/Programming. After graduation, I worked as a BPM developer for two years, where I learned to program logic for various business processes and gained an understanding of data, fields, and state manipulations. This experience had a significant impact on my understanding of system architectures.

Throughout my journey, I realized that my desire to advance my knowledge in creating multi-layer web applications is growing stronger, and I thoroughly enjoy creatively solving and breaking down complex challenges into smaller, manageable ones. I have developed crucial IT skills such as patience, communication (confident, articulate, and professional speaking abilities), and persistence, which I know will help me become a competent and competitive worker in your company.
